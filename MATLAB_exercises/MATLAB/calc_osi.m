function fOSI = calc_osi(vfMeanResp)

% 'vfMeanResp' is a vector containing the average response for each
% stimulus direction, with dimensions (1, stim). You must calculate the
% orientation selectivity index (OSI), as described in the handout.

% Find the preferred stimulus direction. Hint: The 'max' command also
% returns the index of the maximum value.


% Find the index of the stimulus 180º off from preferred. Hint: the 'mod'
% command will be helpful here.


% Find the indices of the two stimuli orthogonal to the preferred stimulus


% Compute the averages of the "preferred" and "orthogonal" stimuli responses

% Compute the OSI using the preferred and orthogonal responses
